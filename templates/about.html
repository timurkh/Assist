	<h4 id="scenarios">How This Portal Could Be Used</h4>
	<p>
	Following scenarious are implemented:
			<h5>Users</h5>
			<p>One can log into the portal using either email/password, FB identity, Google identity or phone (SMS authorization). After first login, email validation is required to proceed. Having email validated, user gets access to the system. It is possible to enable several auth providers for the same account (i.e. use both phone and FB authorization).</p>
			<h5>Squads</h5>
			<p>User can create squads. Squad is visible for every user of the system. Other users can join your squad, or you can add so-called "replicants" to it yourself. If user attempted to join the squad, his status is "Pending Approve". Squad owner can change user status either to Member or Admin. Members recieve notifications, can join events, but are not able to communicate squad or get list of all members. Admin has access to all squad members, also admin can change status of other members (but not admin ones or owner).</p>
			<h5>Notes</h5>
			<p>Squad admins & owner can create notes per squad and per squad member. Squad Notes are intended to store & share information with the whole squad and are visible to all squad members. On the contrary, Member Notes are visible only to squad admins. Member does not have access to notes assigned to him in the squad, unless he is squad admin. 
			<h5>Tags</h5>
			<p>Admins can create Squad Tags, and assign those tags to members. Tags might have values, values are exclusive (only one tag value can be assigned to same member).</p>

	<h4 id="why">Why This Portal Created</h4>
	<p>
	<s>Because I can</s> As a part of technology refresh during my career break after serving 5 years as Executive Director in the world's largest provider of information technology products and services, I decided to implement a system automating certain scenarios which I face in my day-to-day life, mostly related to people, places and events.

	<h4 id="tech">Technologies Used & Source Codes</h4>
	<p>
	This app is written using Go + JS (Vue) + Bootstrap styles and hosted at Google App Engine. Firebase Authentication is used as identity service, Firestore DB is used to store data. Source codes are available <a href="https://github.com/timurkh/Assist"><i class="fab fa-github"></i> here</a>.

	<h4 id="commitment">Can I rely on this system?</h4>
	<p>
	This system uses <a href="https://cloud.google.com/free/docs/gcp-free-tier#free-tier-usage-limits">Google Application Free tier</a> and might get suspended if monthly quota is exceeded. While quota is quite material, there is always an option to deploy the system to your own subscription. Get in touch with author if you want to do it.
